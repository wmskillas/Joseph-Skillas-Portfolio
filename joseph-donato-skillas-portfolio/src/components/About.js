            My first experience with a camera was taking a highschool film
            photography class; the same year I found my parents old home-movie
            palmcorders buried in a closet.

            As a filmmaker, I gravitate towards the use of film and tape to
            create experimental films and documentaries. The medium of analog
            film, resonates a more natural view of how the world looks to us. So
            in a sense I reject the 4K revolution because our eyes can never
            render the world the way modern cameras depict it. I suppose the
            same could have been said for traditional film mediums, but the way
            light interacts with analog formats more closely resembles the very
            biology of our eyes.
